<h1>Hello friends!</h1>
<div class="about-row">
      My name is Lydia and I am 31 years old. 
      I started this blog to share some of the most stunning 
      places I've had the honor of visiting and living in. 
      I was born in Seattle, WA, and lived there until I was 24. 
      Shortly after marrying my husband, Ryan, we moved to England, 
      where we spent three wonderful years. 
      England is rich in people, historic buildings, castles, 
      wildlife, and breathtaking scenery.
      During our time there, we explored various parts of the UK, 
      including Wales, Scotland, and the Scottish Highlands.
      We also traveled to Germany and Liechtenstein before
      the Covid-19 pandemic brought everything to a halt.

<div class="about-row">
  During my time in England, I had the opportunity to work. 
  My first job was as a barista at a small shop called Little Breads.
   I had no experience with 
  an espresso machine, but I was fortunate to have an excellent 
  teacher, Bradley! After about 8 months, Covid-19 hit, and 
  I found myself unable to work for nearly a year. Once shops reopened, 
  I applied for another barista position at LMDC Espresso Bar... 
  and I got the job! LMDC stands for <i>La Maison du Caf√©</i>, 
  which is French for "<b>The House of Coffee</b>." <br>
  Working at LMDC with such an amazing team of people is a memory I 
  will cherish forever.
